# Starting Project

This project marks my first contact with React.

The main goal was to understand the fundamentals of the library, including:
- Component-based architecture
- Dynamic UI updates
- Event handling
- Basic React best practices
- Component re-use

During the practical exercises, I also completed theoretical quizzes to reinforce the core concepts learned throughout the lessons.
