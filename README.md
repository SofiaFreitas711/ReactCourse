# 👩🏻‍💻 React Course

## ℹ️ About this repository

This repository was created to document my learning journey with React.
Each folder contains small projects or exercises focused on a specific React concept.

## 📖 What I've learned so far

- Creating and using functional components
- Passing data via props
- Managing component state with useState
- Handling events (onClick, onChange)
- Conditional rendering
- Rendering lists with map()
- Basic project setup using Vite

## 💻 Code environment

For this course i used *react.new* for every project. This is a way to get a new project on CodeSandBox, with the setup ready!

-OR-

In some cases I used VSCode as my setup!
For that i did:
- open terminal
- npm create vite@latest my-app
- choose 'React'
- choose 'JavaScript'

To start the project:
- npm run dev

## 📋 Learning Notes

### What is React? 

React is a JS library for building UI.

React can create smooth transitions, and load content without the user feeling like the whole page is loading.

#### Why React?

In React, we define the target UI state, and React will figure out and perform the necessary steps to get to the goal.

### About React syntax

React code won't execute in the browser. For that to happen, it uses JSX (JavaScript Syntax eXtension) which is not a default JS feature

Component Function rules:
1. Function name must start with an upper case
2. Multi-word should be written in PascalCase

{} -> tells react it's about to create a dynamic part

Images should be used with import, for a better building deployment
