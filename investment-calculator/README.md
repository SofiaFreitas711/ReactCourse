# 💰 Investment Calculator Project

This project is part of my React learning journey through a Udemy course.
The goal was to build an interactive investment calculator that updates results dynamically based on user input.

## What I practiced
- Managing multiple pieces of state
- Lifting state up to share data between components
- Handling user input and updating the UI in real time
- Working with controlled components
- Rendering calculated results dynamically
- Structuring components for clarity and reusability
