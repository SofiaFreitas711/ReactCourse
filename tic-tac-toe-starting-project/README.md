# TIC-TAC-TOE Project

This project marks my first time working with more advanced concepts.

The main goal was to understand how to build a product that requires multiple state updates wile keeping the code clean and organized.

What I learned in this project
- Managing multiple states
- Lifting state between components
- Updating state immutably
- Handling user interactions
- Rendering dynamic lists (game log, board)
- Conditional UI updates
- Structuring components for clarity
